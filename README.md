# laminarModelGCDereferencing
MATLAB files associated with the IEEE NER 2019 conference paper "Performance evaluation of dereferencing methods for estimating information flow in laminar connectivity models".

Assumes the following toolboxes are present in your MATLAB filepath:

MVGC: http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sackler/mvgc/
iCSD2D:  http://www.neuroinf.pl/Members/szleski/csd2d/Software.2009-10-19.4103
CSDPlotter: https://github.com/espenhgn/CSDplotter

The easiest way to go through it is to probably just start at runFullModelCreationAndGC.m and step through the scripts it calls from there.
